Not at this time.
```

#### Do you have any suggestions to improve this assignment?

```
For problem 2 it would be better to clearly explain and show that there is a problem that needs to be solved and what the desired outcome should produce. Using undefined as the example of the problem and stating that it should log a value using hoisting instead producing undefined.
